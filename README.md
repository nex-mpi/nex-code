We present NeX, a new approach to novel view synthesis based on enhancements of multiplane image (MPI) that can reproduce NeXt-level view-dependent effects---in real time. Unlike traditional MPI that uses a set of simple RGBÎ± planes, our technique models view-dependent effects by instead parameterizing each pixel as a linear combination of basis functions learned from a neural network. Moreover, we propose a hybrid implicit-explicit modeling strategy that improves upon fine detail and produces state-of-the-art results. Our method is evaluated on benchmark forward-facing datasets as well as our newly-introduced dataset designed to test the limit of view-dependent modeling with significantly more challenging effects such as the rainbow reflections on a CD. Our method achieves the best overall scores across all major metrics on these datasets with more than 1000Ã— faster rendering time than the state of the art.

## Getting started

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
./download_demo_data.sh
conda activate nex
python train.py -scene data/crest_demo -model_dir crest -http
tensorboard --logdir runs/
```

## Installation
We provide `environment.yml` to help you setup a conda environment. 

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Dataset
### Shiny dataset

**Download:**  [Shiny dataset](https://vistec-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pakkapon_p_s19_vistec_ac_th/EnIUhsRVJOdNsZ_4smdhye0B8z0VlxqOR35IR3bp0uGupQ?e=TsaQgM). 

We provide 2 directories named `shiny` and `shiny_extended`. 
- `shiny` contains benchmark scenes used to report the scores in our paper.
- `shiny_extended` contains additional challenging scenes used on our website [project page](https://nex-mpi.github.io/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyfkF7Z-ddA)


### NeRF's  real forward-facing dataset
**Download:** [Undistorted front facing dataset](https://vistec-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pakkapon_p_s19_vistec_ac_th/ErjPRRL9JnFIp8MN6d1jEuoB3XVoxJkffPjfoPyhHkj0dg?e=qIunN0)

For real forward-facing dataset, NeRF is trained with the raw images, which may contain lens distortion. But we use the undistorted images provided by COLMAP.

However, you can try running other scenes from [Local lightfield fusion](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF) (Eg. [airplant](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF/blob/master/imgs/viewer.gif)) without any changes in the dataset files. In this case, the images are not automatically undistorted.

### Deepview's spaces dataset
**Download:** [Modified spaces dataset](https://vistec-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pakkapon_p_s19_vistec_ac_th/Euiqlm45zFlItB7eJToHFUUBrIpWH3ehbyUUvpLAL5ulgg?e=Oh0JYN)

We slightly modified the file structure of Spaces dataset in order to determine the plane placement and split train/test sets. 

### Using your own images.

Running NeX on your own images. You need to install [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) on your machine.

Then, put your images into a directory following this structure
```
<scene_name>
|-- images
     | -- image_name1.jpg
     | -- image_name2.jpg
     ...
```

The training code will automatically prepare a scene for you. You may have to tune `planes.txt` to get better reconstruction (see [dataset explaination](https://vistec-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/personal/pakkapon_p_s19_vistec_ac_th/EYBtE-X95pFLscoLFehUMtQBjrrYKQ9mxVEzKzNlDuoZLw?e=bODHZ4))


## Training

Run with the paper's config
```shell
python train.py -scene ${PATH_TO_SCENE} -model_dir ${MODEL_TO_SAVE_CHECKPOINT} -http
```

This implementation uses [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) to resize images during training by default. The results and scores in the paper are generated using OpenCV's resize function. If you want the same behavior, please add `-cv2resize` argument.

Note that this code is tested on an Nvidia V100 32GB and 4x RTX 2080Ti GPU.

For a GPU/GPUs with less memory (e.g., a single RTX 2080Ti), you can run using the following command:
```shell
python train.py -scene ${PATH_TO_SCENE} -model_dir ${MODEL_TO_SAVE_CHECKPOINT} -http -layers 12 -sublayers 6 -hidden 256
```
Note that when your GPU runs out of memory, you can try reducing the number of layers, sublayers, and sampled rays.

## Rendering

To generate a WebGL viewer and a video result.
```shell
python train.py -scene ${scene} -model_dir ${MODEL_TO_SAVE_CHECKPOINT} -predict -http
```

### Video rendering

To generate a video that matches the real forward-facing rendering path, add `-nice_llff` argument, or `-nice_shiny` for shiny dataset
